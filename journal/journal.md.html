2016-10-12: Added MTL and PNG
=============================================================

![](2016-10-12_001_starter_r1549_g3d_r875__.jpg)

Added methods that construct a simple MTL file and a PNG file from the palettes



2016-10-12: Texture Coordinates Implemented!
=============================================================

![](2016-10-12_000_starter_r1549_g3d_r875__.jpg)

Used hashtable to implement texture coordinates and associate each face with a
texture coordinate. Next step is to create the PNG file.



2016-10-10: Inside of culling 2
=============================================================

![](2016-10-10_004_starter_r1525_g3d_r875__.jpg)

Inside the cube created by culling2



2016-10-10: Added extra culling details
=============================================================

![](2016-10-10_003_starter_r1525_g3d_r875__.jpg)

Added another method culling2 that removes the unecessary tiles entirely, but
keep some of the unecessary sides. 



2016-10-10: inside of the MVP
=============================================================

![](2016-10-10_002_starter_r1525_g3d_r875__.jpg)

proof that our culling method actually works



2016-10-10: MVP
=============================================================

![](2016-10-10_001_starter_r1525_g3d_r875__.jpg)

2 hours, used hash table to record where the blocks are stored, and ask whether
they have neightbors to determine if the mesh needs to be created



2016-10-10: figuring out the vertex normals
=============================================================

![](2016-10-10_000_starter_r1525_g3d_r875__.jpg)

BUG: wrote on the file after loading the scene really confused me. Tried really
hard to figure out how the vertex normal works but failing. Fixed the ordering
of the vertices, but still do not understand how x,y,z vertices of the vertex
file correspond with the x,y,z vertices in the obj file 



2016-10-09: Figuring out how to transform data from VOX to OBJ
================================================================
Gave up trying to use articulated model, nor trying to understand the meaning of the positions of VOX, manually written the file in OBJ format.

2016-10-06: Starting the project
=====================================================
Just trying to take an input of VOX file, and using G3D to parse it. (3hours)

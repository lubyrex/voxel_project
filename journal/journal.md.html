2016-10-09: Figuring out how to transform data from VOX to OBJ
================================================================
Gave up trying to use articulated model, nor trying to understand the meaning of the positions of VOX, manually written the file in OBJ format.

2016-10-06: Starting the project
=====================================================
Just trying to take an input of VOX file, and using G3D to parse it. (3hours)

Implementation Design
============================================


An instance of [PathTracer](file:///C:/Users/cs371/Documents/371/3-paths/build/doc/class_path_tracer.html) is given an array of surfaces (hopefully this will also change, from which
it constructs a [G3D::TriTree](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_embree_tri_tree.html) to be used by the intersection methods.

Our [PathTracer::renderScene](file:///C:/Users/cs371/Documents/371/3-paths/build/doc/class_path_tracer.html#ad35e1f10dc56ffabcd7e590540403730) is the the highest level of abstraction. We will be looping over each pixel in the image we want to create, and combining the average of multiple rays (sent at slightly different angles) traced through that pixel to determine its radiance. We will do this with an inverted loop structure, doing all similar actions at the same time and storing the results in buffers to allow for the strategy of SIMD batch-processing multithreading. 

For the actual tracing part of our algorithm, we will be using Monte Carlo integration for calculating direct illumination (using probabilities determined by Importance Sampling). Indirect rays will be shosen using [Surfel::Scatter](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/courses/cs371/f10/G3D/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_surfel.html#a49ece9dda77724eeb09ef8ea745a48f7) to give us optimal convergence.

Code is built upon Ryan's, Eli's, Youle's and Matheus's rays code.

Questions
=============================================================

1. 
    _Why does it take four scattering events to produce a caustic? Give a diagram or otherwise explain what those events are._ 
    
    As the graph suggests, there are exactly 4 rays of light needed in order to travel through all the surfaces of the spheres and hits our eye eventually.

2.
     _Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the global illumination renderer from the Rays project, were it to recurse to an arbitrary path depth. _ 
    
    $n$: pixels,
    $d$: maximum path depth,
    $p$: primary rays per pixel,
    $L$: lights in the scene,
    $r$: recursive rays

    The run time is $O(n×p×L×r^d)$,

    For each pixel in the image, we trace p rays, and computed direct illumination from all sources of light L, and the run time so far is $O(n×p×L)$. For each of these events, we trace back r recursive rays, for d depth, which means in total we create $(r^d)$ rays for each event. Therefore the final run time is $O(n×p×L×r^d)$.
   
3.
    _Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the path tracer from this project using the same variables from the previous question._ 

   The run time is $O(n×p×d)$. 
   
   The reasoning is basically the same as the previous question, except in this project, we use importance sampling and only pick one "important" light from all the light sources to represent all the light source. We also only have 1 recursive ray for every primary ray per pixel.

4. 
    _Derive an algorithm to sample the numbers from 0 to 100 proportional to their value._ 
    
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Use our random generator to get a number f
    f'=49.50×f
    for(i in range (0,100)){
        f'-=i;
        if(f'<0){
            return i;
        }
    }

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
5. 
    _In your own words (and with equations and diagrams as needed), present an mathematically rigorous argument that path tracing as presented in this project converges to a true solution to the rendering equation as the path length and number of paths per pixel approach infinity. State any assumptions underlying that argument explicitly._ 

        When we are calculating the true solution to the rendering equation for a surfel we are looking at the light emitted by that surfel plus the integral of all the light that is being reflected off of that surfel. However, as that is unrealistic to calculate, we approximate looking at all directions by using a Reimann Sum of a discrete number of randomly chosen directions, i.e. ∑L_i(X,L)∗f(ωi,ωo)∗|ωi⋅n|∗β(L,X). 

     We control the span of this sum with two variables: 
        - number of paths per pixel, which controls the number of random directions we are looking at to calculate the indirect light.
        - path length, with controls the number of times we look for indirect light.
  

 Therefore, assuming that as we randomly select directions to look for indirect light we are uniformly sampling the space, as paths per pixel and path length both approach infinity, our Reimann sum should become equivalent to the integral used to find the true solution to the rendering equation.



Self-Review
=============================================================

Overall, we deserve a solid A- / B+.

Code style: I'd say our code could be much cleaner in terms of names and efficiency, but I think it's understa

Workflow (as represented by journal): Our workflow was much better this week (at least for me, Ryan) and so I was much more pleased with how everything went timewise. Definitely room for improvement though. I'd say an A-

Report quality: Our report has some nice images, plus we made it beforehand so had no poor formatting due to time-crunch. So I'd say an A

Report depth/correctness: As far as I can tell, we met all of the spec, provided good test images, and gave in-depth answers for the questons. So I'd say an A-

============================================================
We learned:

    - How to render images using path tracing
    - All of the many maths that went with that
    - How to program in a multi-threading mindset / style
